# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### TODO

- rework version to centralize it to the `pyproject.toml` file
- lint
- consider refactoring more
- consider adding back aspera support (now available from bioconda)
- major bump in version

### Added

- `--ignore` to ignore MD5 checksums

### Changed

- (**BREAKING**) the `--force` flag now overwrites existing files, but will check the MD5
  checksums of the downloaded files. Previously, it would force download the file, but
  ignore the MD5 as well. See https://github.com/rpetit3/fastq-dl/issues/21#issuecomment-2190686184
  for more details. Use the newly added `--ignore` flag to ignore MD5 checksums too.

## [1.1.0]

Big thanks to @mbhall88 for submitting https://github.com/rpetit3/fastq-dl/pull/5 with the following improvements!

## Added
- `-o` shorthand option for `--outdir`
- a flag `-F/--only-provider`, which supercedes `--sra_only`. I left `--sra_only` in there for backwards compatibility and added a deprecation notice in the help description for it.
- Conda environment file
- Dockerfile. Feel free to try out an image from my quay.io repo [here](https://quay.io/repository/mbhall88/fastq-dl?tab=tags).

## Changed
- Move everything into a `main` function to avoid [variable shadowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing)
- Provider is now optional and defaults to `ena`. I've also made the option case insensitive, rather than listing the cased versions of the available providers
- If ENA download fails, try SRA
- Reduced a bunch of `execute` calls which were mostly operations easily dealt with by `pathlib.Path`
- Changed `md5sum` to use `hashlib.md5` instead of executing a subprocess call to `md5sum`
- Moved a bunch of `import` statements out of function bodies to the top of the file

## Removed
- Docstring at top of file as this is a mirror of argparse's help menu and creates needless maintenance

[1.1.0]: https://github.com/rpetit3/fastq-dl/compare/v1.0.6...v1.1.0
